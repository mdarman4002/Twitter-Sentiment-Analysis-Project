## Project Description: Twitter Sentiment Analysis on Modi and Rahul Gandhi Tweets

For my project, Twitter Sentiment Analysis, I focused on analyzing tweets related to Narendra Modi and Rahul Gandhi to predict who might win the 2019 elections. I used a dataset from Kaggle that contained tweets about both political figures, labeled as positive, negative, or neutral.

I applied various machine learning algorithms, including Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, CatBoost, and XGBoost, to classify the sentiment of the tweets. The first step involved preprocessing the data: I cleaned the tweets by removing special characters and links, then transformed the text into numerical features using techniques like TF-IDF.

After training and evaluating each model, I assessed their performance with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results revealed that CatBoost and Logistic Regression provided the best accuracy, making them effective choices for sentiment classification.

Finally, I visualized the sentiment trends over time for both leaders, which helped illustrate public perception leading up to the election. This project enhanced my understanding of machine learning techniques and how sentiment analysis can provide insights into political dynamics on social media.
