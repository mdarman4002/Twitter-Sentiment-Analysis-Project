# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis-Project

## Project Description: Twitter Sentiment Analysis on Modi and Rahul Gandhi Tweets

For my project, Twitter Sentiment Analysis, I focused on analyzing tweets related to Narendra Modi and Rahul Gandhi to predict who might win the 2019 elections. I used a dataset from Kaggle that contained tweets about both political figures, labeled as positive, negative, or neutral.

I applied various machine learning algorithms, including Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, CatBoost, and XGBoost, to classify the sentiment of the tweets. The first step involved preprocessing the data: I cleaned the tweets by removing special characters and links, then transformed the text into numerical features using techniques like TF-IDF.

After training and evaluating each model, I assessed their performance with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results revealed that CatBoost and Logistic Regression provided the best accuracy, making them effective choices for sentiment classification.

Finally, I visualized the sentiment trends over time for both leaders, which helped illustrate public perception leading up to the election. This project enhanced my understanding of machine learning techniques and how sentiment analysis can provide insights into political dynamics on social media.

## Roles and Responsibilities for Twitter Sentiment Analysis Project

Data Collection: Sourced tweets related to Narendra Modi and Rahul Gandhi from a Kaggle dataset, ensuring the data was relevant for analyzing sentiments leading up to the 2019 elections.

Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and preprocessed the tweet data by removing noise, such as URLs and special characters. Tokenized the text and applied transformations using TF-IDF to prepare it for analysis.

Model Development: Implemented various machine learning algorithms, including Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, CatBoost, and XGBoost, to classify the sentiment of tweets. Developed and fine-tuned each model to optimize performance.

Model Evaluation: Evaluated the performance of each model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Compared results to determine the most effective algorithm for sentiment classification.

Visualization: Created visual representations of sentiment trends over time for both political figures using tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn, highlighting public sentiment shifts as the election approached.

Report Generation: Compiled a comprehensive report detailing the project methodology, findings, and insights. Included visualizations and analysis to present a clear understanding of the sentiment landscape regarding Modi and Rahul Gandhi leading up to the elections.

Presentation: Delivered a presentation in front of my class and faculty, showcasing the projectâ€™s objectives, methodology, and results. Engaged the audience in a discussion about the implications of the findings and the relevance of sentiment analysis in political contexts.

Feedback and Improvement: Gathered feedback from classmates and faculty to improve my analysis and presentation skills, as well as to refine the project for future applications.
